**Content Overview:**

* **Classification Model (Q1):**
    * Uses the Iris dataset.
    * Implements a Random Forest Classifier.
    * Includes steps for data loading, preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
    * Calculates metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    * Determines feature importance.

* **Clustering Model (Q2):**
    * Also uses the Iris dataset.
    * Performs K-Means clustering.
    * Includes data preprocessing steps like feature scaling.
    * Evaluates clustering using the Silhouette score.
    * Visualizes the clusters and compares them with the actual species labels.
    * Prints the cluster centers.

**Libraries Used:**

* pyspark.sql
* pyspark.ml.feature
* pyspark.ml.classification
* pyspark.ml.clustering
* pyspark.ml.evaluation

**Purpose:**

The notebook demonstrates the implementation of fundamental machine learning tasks (classification and clustering) using Spark's machine learning library (MLlib). It provides a clear, step-by-step guide with explanations, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for similar projects.
