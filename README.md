**Content Overview:**
### Q1. Build a Classification Model with Spark with a dataset of your choice

**Objective:**
Develop a classification model using Spark to predict categories or labels from a given dataset.

**Steps:**

1.  **Load the Dataset:**
    * Load your chosen dataset into a Spark DataFrame. For example, the Iris dataset is used in the provided code.

2.  **Prepare the Data:**
    * Preprocess the data as needed. This might involve:
        * Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
        * Combining relevant features into a single vector column.
        * Handling missing values.
        * Scaling features.

3.  **Split the Data:**
    * Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

4.  **Create and Train the Model:**
    * Select a classification algorithm from Spark MLlib (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
    * Set the necessary parameters for the chosen model.
    * Train the model using the training dataset.

5.  **Make Predictions:**
    * Use the trained model to generate predictions on the test dataset.

6.  **Evaluate the Model:**
    * Assess the model's performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

7.  **Feature Importance:**
    * (Optional) For tree-based models, extract and display feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.


### Q2. Build a Clustering Model with Spark with a dataset of your choice.

**Objective:**
Develop a clustering model using Spark to group data points into clusters based on their similarity.

**Steps:**

1.  **Load the Dataset:**
    * Load your chosen dataset into a Spark DataFrame.  Again, the Iris dataset is used in the example, but this time for clustering.

2.  **Prepare the Data:**
    * Preprocess the data:
        * Combine features into a single vector column.
        * Scale the features (this is often crucial for clustering algorithms like K-Means).
        * Handle any missing values.

3.  **Create the Clustering Model:**
    * Choose a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) from Spark MLlib.
    * Set the parameters, including the number of clusters.

4.  **Train the Model:**
    * Train the clustering model using the prepared data.

5.  **Get Cluster Predictions:**
    * Assign each data point to a cluster using the trained model.

6.  **Evaluate the Clustering:**
    * Evaluate the quality of the clustering (e.g., using the Silhouette score).

7.  **Visualize the Clusters:**
    * (Optional) If the data has 2 or 3 dimensions, visualize the clusters to get a better understanding of the results.

8.  **Compare with Actual Labels:**
    * (Optional and for evaluation purposes only) If you have true labels, you can compare the clusters with the actual categories to see how well the clustering aligns, but these labels are *not* used during the clustering process itself.

9.  **Cluster Centers:**
    * Display the cluster centers to understand the characteristics of each cluster.

### Q3. Build a Recommendation Engine with Spark with a dataset of your choice.

**Objective:**
Develop a recommendation engine using Spark to predict user ratings for items.

**Steps:**

1.  **Load the Dataset:**
    * Utilize the MovieLens dataset, loading the ratings data into a Spark DataFrame.

2.  **Prepare the Data:**
    * Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

3.  **Create the Recommendation Model:**
    * Employ Alternating Least Squares (ALS) from the Spark MLlib library to build the movie recommendation model.
    * Set appropriate parameters such as `maxIter`, `regParam`, and `userCol`, `itemCol`, `ratingCol`.

4.  **Train the Model:**
    * Train the ALS model using the training dataset.

5.  **Make Predictions:**
    * Generate predictions on the test dataset.

6.  **Evaluate the Model:**
    * Assess the model's accuracy using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

7.  **Generate Recommendations:**
    * For each user, recommend the top N movies they haven't rated yet.
    * For each movie, find the top N users who might like it.

8.  **Display Results:**
    * Show a sample of the predictions.
    * Display the top recommendations for a specific user and top users for a specific movie.

**Libraries Used:**

* pyspark.sql
* pyspark.ml.feature
* pyspark.ml.classification
* pyspark.ml.clustering
* pyspark.ml.evaluation
* pyspark.ml
* sklearn.datasets
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot

**Purpose:**

The notebook demonstrates the implementation of fundamental machine learning tasks (classification and clustering) using Spark's machine learning library (MLlib). It provides a clear, step-by-step guide with explanations, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for similar projects.
